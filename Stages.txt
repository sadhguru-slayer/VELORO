### Project Development Stages: Backend + Frontend with Freelancer Bidding Feature  

---

### **Phase 1: Core Backend Setup**  üëç

**Tasks:**  
1. Backend Initialization  
   1.1. Set up the Django project with essential configurations (e.g., PostgreSQL/SQLite integration, settings for security and scalability).  
   1.2. Create user roles (`Client`, `Freelancer`) and implement JWT/OAuth-based authentication.  

2. User Management API  
   2.1. Create endpoints for user registration, login, and profile management.  
   2.2. Ensure role-based access control (e.g., clients can post projects; freelancers can bid).  

3. Project Posting API  
   3.1. Implement APIs for project creation, allowing clients to post projects with details (title, description, budget, deadline).  
   3.2. Make projects public by default, visible to all freelancers.  

4. Bidding Mechanism API  
   4.1. Design endpoints for freelancers to place bids, including details like bid amount, completion duration, and optional notes.  
   4.2. Link bids to specific freelancers and projects.  
   4.3. Create endpoints for clients to view and accept/reject bids.  

5. Database Models  
   5.1. Define models for `User`, `Project`, `Bid`, and related attributes (e.g., bid amount, bid status).  

6. Notifications (Optional at this stage)  
   6.1. Add basic support for notifications (e.g., when a freelancer places a bid, the client is notified).  

7. Integration Points  
   7.1. Ensure API responses are well-documented using Swagger or similar tools for frontend consumption.

### **Phase 2: Core Frontend Setup**  

**Tasks:**  
1. Frontend Initialization  
   1.1. Set up a React project with Tailwind CSS for styling.  
   1.2. Configure routing using React Router for key pages (e.g., Login, Dashboard, Project Details).  

2. User Authentication  
   2.1. Implement user registration and login forms.  
   2.2. Use backend authentication APIs to handle login sessions (store JWT in secure cookies/local storage).  

3. Project Posting UI  
   3.1. Create a form for clients to post projects, integrating with the project posting API.  
   3.2. Add validation for project details (e.g., budget must be numeric).  

4. Project Listing for Freelancers  
   4.1. Build a dashboard where freelancers can browse posted projects.  
   4.2. Use the project listing API to fetch and display projects.  

5. Bidding UI  
   5.1. Add a bidding interface for freelancers (modal or page) to place bids on projects.  
   5.2. Display active bids for each project on the project details page.  
   5.3. Create a list view for clients to see and manage bids (accept/reject).

### **Phase 3: Real-Time Features**  

**Tasks:**  
1. DB Enhance for all the features based on frontend
2. Create API End points for get features or listing features first
3. Test and Manage the fetched data in frontend
4. Create API End point for POST requests to store & validate like Posting Project, Tasks, Bidding, Comments on bids by freelancer

**Phase 3.2: Real-Time Features**  

**Tasks:**

### **Phase 4: File Sharing and Collaboration**  

**Tasks:**  
1. File Upload/Download  
   1.1. Add secure file upload and download APIs.  
   1.2. Build frontend components for file management within projects.  

2. Dashboard for Clients and Freelancers  
   2.1. Display project overviews for clients (tasks, files, progress updates, freelancer details).  
   2.2. Show assigned tasks, deadlines, and client feedback for freelancers.  

3. Task Progress Tracking  
   3.1. Build APIs and UI components for task management (e.g., status updates).  

---

### **Phase 5: Testing and Optimization**  

**Tasks:**  
1. Testing  
   1.1. Write unit tests for all backend APIs and models.  
   1.2. Test all frontend components for proper integration with the backend.  
   1.3. Conduct end-to-end testing for the bidding feature and project collaboration flow.  

2. Optimization  
   2.1. Optimize API responses for speed.  
   2.2. Minimize frontend load times using code splitting and lazy loading.  

3. Security  
   3.1. Secure WebSockets for chat and real-time updates.  
   3.2. Implement HTTPS, input sanitization, and data encryption for sensitive operations.

### **Phase 6: Deployment**  

**Tasks:**  
1. Backend Deployment  
   1.1. Deploy the Django backend to Heroku or Render (using their free tiers initially).  

2. Frontend Deployment  
   2.1. Host the React frontend on Vercel or Netlify.  

3. Domain Configuration  
   3.1. Link both deployments under a single domain (e.g., using a custom domain name).  

4. Testing on Production  
   4.1. Test all features in the production environment.
